# Introduction
## "Hello World!" in C: Easy
### Objective

In this challenge, we will learn some basic concepts of C that will get you started with the language. You will need to use the same syntax to read input and write output in many C challenges. As you work through these problems, review the code stubs to learn about reading from stdin and writing to stdout.

### Task

This challenge requires you to print ```Hello, World!``` on a single line, and then print the already provided input string to [stdout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_.28stdout.29). If you are not familiar with C, you may want to read about the printf() command.
